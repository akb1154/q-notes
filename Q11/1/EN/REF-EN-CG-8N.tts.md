# Show and Tell Script

Obj: CPU (AMD Athlon III & Server CPU?);

My Thoughts: 
- boils down to simple switches 
- gets complicated very quickly
- acomplishes many things through the power of math. 

How it relates to society: 
- everything runs on maths (Computers nowadays)
    - Smartphones, Elmos, PCs
- many simple things can come together to form a big complicated thing.

Questions: 
- What is this? 
- who knows where this goes?
