# Guantanamo Bay (military prison)

*not to be confused with the province in Cuba*,

## Difficulties in releasing prisoners from Guantanamo Bay

- the Trump administration (7E0-7E4) froze transfers
- Biden has not appointed an envoy dedicated to negotiate transfers  
  - Transfer negotiations take long
  - they need to negotiate rehab, resource gaps, etc.
- The incarceration is arbitrary
  - none of the detainees are charged
  - some of them are cases of mistaken identity

The difficulties in releasing detainees from the Guantánamo bay military prison mostly
lie in three main causes, they consist of the Trump administration (2017-2021) halting
the transfers, the Biden administration (2021 - 2025 (or 2029)) not doing enough and
the incarceration being arbitrary.

## Analysis of the authors attitude towards the process of relasing detainees

The author is most likely for the release of the detainees in Guantánamo Bay, judging
from the opinions of the cited people. they try to show the chaos of Guantánamo Bay
from a neutral point of view, as they are reporting on news, but they have mostly
cited (/interviewed) people who are for the closing of Guantánamo Bay and the release
of all its detainees.

## Cartoon analysis

In this grayscale cartoon by Taylor Jones a bald eagle is depicted whose right eye is closed.
On the right eyelid the word "Guantánamo" is depicted. the cartoon is referring to the military
prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba and the atrocities (-> torture, arbitrary incarceration) connected
to it to which the bald eagle &mdash; the national bird of the US &mdash; is "turning a blind eye
towards", this represents the Ignorance of the Americans to this topic.
