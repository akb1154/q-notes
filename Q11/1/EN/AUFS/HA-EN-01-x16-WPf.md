To discuss the question of the greatest challenge Generation Z ('Gen Z') has to face, the term Gen Z should be defined. 

It is the generation following the Millennials and preceding Generation X, with People born between *1997/1998* and *2012*, being the first generation having grown up with access to the Internet and portable digital technology. Gen Z are considered "digital natives", even though, according to [Valerie Strauss from the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/16/todays-kids-may-be-digital-natives-new-study-shows-they-arent-close-being-computer-literate/?outputType=amp), they need not be digitally literate.  

As the people of the generation are still *relatively young* ; Gen Z will be experiencing the global Climate Change while both grow. Even though some people say that the (near)*dystopian* future that leading climate scientists predict may be wrong, the available climate data shows otherwise.  Predictions by the [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/2019/09/25/srocc-press-release/) predict, that the average sea level will have risen considerably by the year 2100.

Another big problem of Gen Z also being considered the "*most unhappy generation ever*", which can be seen in the increased consumption of not prescribed, psychoactive drugs, according to [Charles Hymas from The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/12/09/generation-z-swap-drink-drugs-class-use-16-24-year-olds-rises/), although, [according to UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/headlines/2020/aug/how-fix-unhappiest-generation-ever) ,  Gen Z does not have some of the major problems that plagued the previous generations, those being the consumption of Alcohol and the rate of teenage pregnancies have decreased.

To conclude it is viable to say that the greatest challenge to Gen Z is most likely the currently ongoing crisis of climate change; In my opinion the predicted near dystopian future will drastically add onto the semi-stereotype of Gen-Z being the saddest and or the most depressed generation ever.

## [WP-02]: How Competitive is Gen-Z?

> *Comment on the following statement: **People in our generation are incredibly competitive**.*

The statement of the People in Gen Z being at least one of the most competitive if not *the* most competitive People may be debatable. 

An argument for the statement being right may, as stated in this [scion advisory article](https://scionadvisory.com/competitive-or-collaborative-understanding-generation-z-characteristics-that-may-impact-student-housing/), be that the values given to many, if not most of the people, born between *1997/1998* and *2012*, are, among others being successful at both school and their place or places of work.

Although Most people in this Demographic are the Children of the people in the generation preceding the Millennials, Generation X, according to [Beth Stebner from the New York daily news](https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/millennials-competitive-crave-attention-study-article-1.1811762), a dutch study shows that the most competitive generation may actually be the Millennials, the generation before Gen Z, according to the aforementioned dutch study the reason in Millennials being the most competitive generation might actually be a craving for attention.

Others, like the [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/who-is-gen-z-how-they-impact-workplace1906.html#close), say that the reasons for the competitiveness may lie among other factors in a desire to find or create meaning and a motivation to contribute to the world, although they also state that people in Gen Z  are expecting less validation in their actions, 
on the other hand again Gen Z may be more entrepreneurial, motivated by security, independent, willing to do research and driven by financial goals.  "Winning" a competition can lead to validation, security in oneself and help in being independent as well as reaching financial goals.

With the aforementioned a conclusion, that Gen Z may be actually very competitive, can safely be reached.   


## [WP-0ろ]: Should 寺いの学 be abolished?
> *Should Religious Education be abolished?*

The question if religious education should be abolished is a highly debated question. 

A [study done by Carolyn Evans in 2008 published in the Oxford University Press](https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article-abstract/8/3/449/641546)  concludes that "Children need to be given the tools to understand the role of religion in their society and in the world, but they must be protected from indoctrination by their teachers or school officials".  The mentioned problem of indoctrination is one of the main points against religious education in public schools. 

The abolishment of religious education in public schools does not infringe on the fourth paragraph of the german constitution, as it actually does not hinder people from practicing their religious beliefs. The time for worship should be outside of School hours, people may get their Religious Education at home or their place of worship, eg. churches, mosques, temples or synagouges among others. 

The curriculum for roman catholic christian religious education in german public schools is determined by the roman catholic church, and thus may be susceptible to morphing into indoctrination, that may not be discussed critically. Many people, if indoctrinated, do not question their own religious beliefs, due to psychological barriers, built up by the doctrine and the social and peer pressure, as told by a psychological therapist and YouTube Content Creator [Theramintrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xqCkx6WQBE).  It also leads to accepting logical Contradictions without questioning. 

This and my own experience with religion and thedecision to leave it, lead me to the conclusion that it might be a good Idea to abolish at least the requirement of having religious education in german public schools and leave the choice, if they would like (for example) optional religous education alongside ethics lessons, or let those who would like to have their religious education   go to their place of worship and recieve it there.
