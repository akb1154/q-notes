## \[Mediation\]: Nobelpreisträger Satyarthi &mdash; Anwalt der gequälten Kinder

Hello, my fellow people! Today, we have a special guest visiting us from India — Mr. Kailash Satyarthi — who has won the Nobel Peace Price in *2014* for his work in freeing children from forced labour, which sadly is still prevalent in India, due to them working harder, following faster and questioning less. He is the founder of Bachpan Bachao Andolan — the Movement to save Childhood — <!--Childhood Help Protest-->and has saved over 50 million <!--go sen man--> children under the age of 14 since leaving his job as an electrical engineer. Sadly the Movement clashes with the Indian government often as many factory owners paid some corrupt officers to make them look away, but if they succeed to talk them over to start a police raid of the factory, the Movement joins the raid and brings the newly freed children to a New Home in a children's home working with the Movement. Mr. Satyarthi introduced a certificate for carpets produced without the use of child labour. He is trying to raise awareness about child labour and will tell us about his awesome work. Thank you for coming here Mr. Satyarthi, the stage is yours.
